Multiple language
---
* You may download `src/_locales/en/messages.json` and translate it into your
  own language, and then make a pull request.

* If you are working with an existed language file, the newly added items will
  have empty `message`s.
  You may then check out `src/_locales/en/messages.json` for the English version
  and translate it.
